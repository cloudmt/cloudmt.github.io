    <h3> 1871, Sebastopol </h3>    
    <a href = "http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/1871/jpg/4396765_00403.jpg" target = "_blank">
      This link contains Thomas Blackall, perhaps the only farmstead on Cloud Mountain in 1863
    </a>

    <h3> 1901, Algona South </h3>
    <a href = "http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/1901/z/z002/jpg/z000098433.jpg" target = "_blank">
      This link lists the Bennett family that most likely lived in one of the 2 farmsteads on the Cloud Mountain property (behind the Sirdevan cabin) and appears to be the same Patrick referenced in the 1871 census. Cross reference this with the Margaret Bennett grave pic, buried with her husband Patrick (see Cormac grave photo gallery link below)

    <h2> General History </h2>
    
    <p>
    
      The murky beginnings... (in chronological order): <br><br>
      
      Father McNulty established a parish at Mount St Patrick around 1838  (The Story of Cormac pg 1) which is here http://goo.gl/maps/bzrhb
      http://www.greatermadawaska.com/tourism/History/MountStPatrickAndDacre.php <br><br>
      
      Of interest, the first sentence “The first settlers to appear in what would become the Parish of Mount St. Patrick probably arrived in the 1830s. No one knows for certain because these settlers could be considered squatters since there was no land registry until the 1850s.”
      Father McCormac is the brother of Father James McCormac who founds Cormac <br><br>
      
      Perhaps the first “settlement” near Cormac is Lake Clear?:  “In 1844-45 Father McNulty built log churches at Brudenell, Douglas, Eganville, Osceola and Renfrew.  In 1847 Father McNulty visited Lake Clear, which he called McDonald’s settlement and chronicled it as one of his missions for the five years following” (The Story of Cormac pg 2)
      there was a Sebastopol chapel begun in 1859 on the Opeongo Rd (The Story of Cormac pg 4, people-and-places-of-yesterday pg 1) <br><br>
      
      Father James McCormac began constructing the original St Ann’s in 1891 in what would become Cormac
      the Opeongo Rd was “completed” in 1864, in that it now went from Renfrew to Barry’s Bay <br><br>
